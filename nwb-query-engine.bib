Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for EEG/ERP
   (electroencephalography, event-related potentials) data and metadata
   storage and processing and to summarize the authors' research in this
   field. Since researchers have difficulties with a suitable long-term
   storage and management of electrophysiology data the presented system
   helps them to increase both efficiency and effectiveness of their work
   by providing the means for the storage, management, search and sharing
   of EEG/ERP data. The requirements specification including the system
   context, system requirements, project scope, basic features, system
   users, and data formats and metadata structures are presented. The
   database structure is proposed; upload, download and interchange of
   EEG/ERP data and metadata using the web interface are described. The
   system architecture, used technologies and the final realization are
   described. Data and metadata search over the system and user accounts
   including system security management are also presented. Additional
   tools and structures as converters of data formats and semantic web
   ontology are mentioned.}},

We have developed Sesame, an architecture for efficient storage and expressive querying of large quantities of metadata in RDF and RDF Schema. Sesame's design and implementation are independent from any specific storage device. Thus, Sesame can be deployed on top of a variety of storage devices, such as relational databases, triple stores, or object-oriented databases, without having to change the query engine or other functional modules. Sesame offers support for concurrency control, independent export of RDF and RDFS information and a query engine for RQL, a query language for RDF that offers native support for RDF Schema semantics. We present an overview of Sesame as a generic architecture, as well as its implementation and our first experiences with this implementation.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract. We present an approach for mapping an OWL ontology into Java. The basic idea is to create a set of Java interfaces and classes from an OWL ontology such that an instance of a Java class represents an instance of a single class of the ontology with most of its properties, classrelationships and restriction-definitions maintained. We note that there exist some fundamental semantic differences between Description Logic (DL) and Object Oriented (OO) systems, primarily related to completeness and satisfiability. We present various ways in which we aim to minimize the impact of such differences, and show how to map a large part of the much richer OWL semantics into Java. Finally, we sketch the HarmonIA framework, which is used for the automatic generation of agent systems from institution specifications, and whose OWL Ontology Creation module was the basis for the tool presented in this paper.}},

   abstract = {The overarching goal of the NIF (Neuroscience Information Framework) project is to be a one-stop-shop for Neuroscience. This paper provides a technical overview of how the system is designed. The technical goal of the first version of the NIF system was to develop an information system that a neuroscientist can use to locate relevant information from a wide variety of information sources by simple keyword queries. Although the user would provide only keywords to retrieve information, the NIF system is designed to treat them as concepts whose meanings are interpreted by the system. Thus, a search for term should find a record containing synonyms of the term. The system is targeted to find information from web pages, publications, databases, web sites built upon databases, XML documents and any other modality in which such information may be published. We have designed a system to achieve this functionality. A central element in the system is an ontology called NIFSTD (for NIF Standard) constructed by amalgamating a number of known and newly developed ontologies. NIFSTD is used by our ontology management module, called OntoQuest to perform ontology-based search over data sources. The NIF architecture currently provides three different mechanisms for searching heterogeneous data sources including relational databases, web sites, XML documents and full text of publications. Version 1.0 of the NIF system is currently in beta test and may be accessed through http://nif.nih.gov .},

ABSTRACT={Progress in experimental tools and design is allowing the acquisition of increasingly large datasets. Storage, manipulation and efficient analyses of such large amounts of data is now a primary issue. We present OpenElectrophy, an electrophysiological data and analysis sharing framework developed to fill this niche. It stores all experiment data and meta-data in a single central MySQL database, and provides a graphic user interface to visualize and explore the data, and a library of functions for user analysis scripting in Python. It implements multiple spike sorting methods, and oscillation detection based on the ridge extraction methods due to Roux et. al., 2007. OpenElectrophy is open-source and is freely available for download at http://neuralensemble.org/trac/OpenElectrophy.}}

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Experimental descriptions are typically stored as free text without using standardized terminology, creating challenges in comparison, reproduction and analysis. These difficulties impose limitations on data exchange and information retrieval.RESULTS:The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), developed as a global, cross-community effort, provides a resource that represents biomedical investigations in an explicit and integrative framework. Here we detail three real-world applications of OBI, provide detailed modeling information and explain how to use OBI.CONCLUSION:We demonstrate how OBI can be applied to different biomedical investigations to both facilitate interpretation of the experimental process and increase the computational processing and integration within the Semantic Web. The logical definitions of the entities involved allow computers to unambiguously understand and integrate different biological experimental processes and their relevant components.AVAILABILITY:OBI is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/2009-11-02/obi.owl webcite}},

While high levels of data integrity are expected, research teams have diverse backgrounds, are geographically dispersed, and rarely possess a primary interest in data science. Here we describe DataJoint, an open-source toolbox designed for manipulating and processing scientific data under the relational data model. Designed for scientists who need a flexible and expressive database language with few basic concepts and operations, DataJoint facilitates multi-user access, efficient queries, and distributed computing. With implementations in both MATLAB and Python, DataJoint is not limited to particular file formats, acquisition systems, or data modalities and can be quickly adapted to new experimental designs. DataJoint and related resources are available at http://datajoint.github.com.},

ABSTRACT={Neuroscience continues to experience a tremendous growth  in data; in terms of the volume and variety of data,  the velocity at which data  is acquired, and in turn the veracity of data.  These challenges are  a serious impediment to sharing of data, analyses, and  tools within and  across labs. Here, we introduce BRAINformat, a novel data standardization framework for the design  and management of scientific data  formats. The BRAINformat library defines  application-independent design concepts and  modules that together create a general framework for standardization of scientific data.  We describe the formal specification of scientific data  standards, which facilitates sharing and  verification  of data  and  formats.  We introduce the  concept of Managed Objects, enabling  semantic components of data formats to be specified as self-contained units, supporting modular and  reusable design of data  format  components and  file storage. We also  introduce the  novel  concept of Relationship Attributes  for modeling and  use  of semantic relationships between data objects.  Based on these concepts we demonstrate the application of our framework to design and  implement a standard format  for electrophysiology data  and  show  how  data standardization and relationship-modeling facilitate data  analysis and sharing. The format uses HDF5, enabling  portable,  scalable, and self-describing data  storage and integration  with modern high-performance computing  for data-driven discovery. The BRAINformat library is open  source, easy-to-use, and provides detailed user  and developer documentation and is freely available at: https://bitbucket.org/oruebel/brainformat.}
